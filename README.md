# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains my personal practice of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in the C programming language. Each directory focuses on a specific concept.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a major data structure or algorithm category.

-   **/Arrays**: Implementations of dynamic arrays and common array-based problems.
-   **/LinkedLists**: Code for Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists and their operations.
-   **/Stacks**: Implementations of Stack ADT using arrays and linked lists.
-   **/Queues**: Implementations of Queue ADT, including simple, circular, and priority queues.
-   **/Trees**: Code for various tree structures like Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, and Heaps.
-   **/Sorting**: A collection of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
-   **/Searching**: Implementations of Linear Search and Binary Search.
-   **/Hashing**: Code for hash tables with different collision resolution techniques.

## How to Compile and Run

All programs are written in standard C. You can use a C compiler like GCC to compile and run the files.

1.  **Navigate to a specific directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <directory_name>
    ```

2.  **Compile the C file:**
    ```bash
    gcc <program_name>.c -o <output_name>
    ```

3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./<output_name>
    ```
